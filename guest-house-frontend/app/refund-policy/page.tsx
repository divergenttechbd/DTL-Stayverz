            A "Booking Issue" refers to situations where<br/>

            <b>The Host cancels:</b> This includes last-minute cancellations or failing to provide access to the booked accommodation (e.g., missing keys).<br/>
            <b>Misrepresentation in Listing:</b> The listing description significantly differs from reality in aspects like size, type (entire home vs. shared room), amenities (unavailable pools, decks, etc.), or undisclosed co-habitants.<br/>
            <b>Unacceptable Accommodation:</b> Upon arrival, you encounter issues like uncleanliness, safety hazards, vermin, or pets not mentioned in the listing.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>



            <span className='text-brandColor font-semibold mb-2 block text-lg'>Your Rights Under This Policy</span>
            As a Guest encountering a Booking Issue, this policy grants you specific rights that supersede the Host's cancellation policy<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <span className='text-brandColor font-semibold mb-2 block text-lg'>Host Cancellation Policies</span>
            Hosts have the flexibility to choose a cancellation policy for their listings. Here's a breakdown of the available options (keeping in mind up to 30% goes to Stayverz as a service fee):<br/>

            <b>Flexible:</b> Offers an 85% refund for cancellations made 24 hours before check-in. For bookings longer than a day, a 35% refund applies if canceled by 3 pm on check-in day (excluding the first night's fee). Single-day bookings are non-refundable.<br/>
            <b>Semi-Flexible:</b> Similar to Flexible, but with a 72-hour cancellation window for the 85% refund. The 35% refund rule for cancellations by 3 pm on check-in day applies to bookings exceeding one day.<br/>
            <b>Moderate:</b> Provides an 85% refund (minus service fee) for cancellations made 5 days before check-in. Bookings over a day qualify for a 35% refund if canceled by 3 pm on check-in day (excluding the first night's fee and total service fee). Single-day bookings are non-refundable.<br/>
            <b>Semi-Strict:</b> Offers a 35% refund for cancellations made 14 days before check-in. No refunds are provided after that.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>

            <span className='text-brandColor font-semibold mb-2 block text-lg'>How to File a Claim</span>
            To submit a valid claim for a Booking Issue and receive a refund or assistance, you must adhere to these conditions:<br/>
            
            <b>1. Be the Booking Guest: </b>The claim can only be filed by the Guest who made the reservation.<br/>
            <b>2. Report Promptly: </b>You must notify Stayverz about the Booking Issue within 24 hours of discovery. Provide details (photos, videos, or written evidence) about the problem and the accommodation.<br/>
            <b>3. Cooperate with Requests: </b>Respond promptly to any requests for additional information or cooperation from Stayverz regarding the Booking Issue.<br/>
            <b>4. Not Cause the Issue: </b>The Booking Issue shouldn't be a direct result of your actions or negligence.<br/>
            <b>5. Attempt Resolution (if possible): </b>You must make reasonable efforts to resolve the Booking Issue with the Host, unless advised otherwise by Stayverz.<br/>
            <b>6. Refund Payout Process: </b>If the claim is approved, the refund will be disbursed within 7 to 10 working days.<br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>



            <span className='text-brandColor font-semibold mb-2 block text-lg'>Host Responsibilities and Reimbursement</span>
            As a Host, you're responsible for ensuring your listed accommodations are:<br/>
            <ul>
              <li className='list-disc'>Accessible</li>
              <li className='list-disc'>Accurately Represented in Listings</li>
              <li className='list-disc'>Safe and Clean</li>
              <li className='list-disc'>Free of Booking Issues</li>
            </ul>
            You should also be available (or have someone available) to address Guest concerns and attempt to resolve Booking Issues during their stay.
            If Stayverz determines a Guest has encountered a Booking Issue and reimburses them, Stayverz Payments is authorized to collect the owed amount by reducing your payout according to the Terms of Use and Host Agreement.
            <br/>
            <br/>



            <span className='text-brandColor font-semibold mb-2 block text-lg'>Dispute Resolution</span>
            If you're a Host disputing a Booking Issue claim, you can notify Stayverz with details and evidence contradicting the Guest's claims. You should also make reasonable efforts to resolve the issue with the Guest unless advised otherwise by Stayverz.
            <br/>
            <br/>


            <span className='text-brandColor font-semibold mb-2 block text-lg'>Changes to This Policy</span>
            Stayverz reserves the right to modify or terminate this Guest Refund Policy at any time. We will announce any changes on the platform and continue processing claims for Booking Issues made before the effective date of the modification according to the then-applicable policy.
